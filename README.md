# Best-CS-GO-Config
This just a csgo config that I've been working on with buy binds, editing the map to make it look better, and a custom cross hair which is pretty neat 

The Buy Binds on keybad: 

  1: Buy Flash
  2: Buy Smoke
  3: Buy molotov
  0: Buy HE Grenade
  Period / Delete key: Defuse Kit
  Enter: buys armour (and helmet if you can afford it)
  + : Buys Five-seven / Tec-9
  / , * , - : buys a scout, AWP, and Auto in that order
  4 , 5 , 6: buys famas/galil, m4/ak , sg553/aug in that order
  7 , 8 , 9: buys UMP , P90 , mp7/mp5-sd in that order
  
Crosshair Binds:
  
  "," Enables dynamic crosshair dot
  "." Enables static crosshair dot
  
"=" button on keyboard mutes and unmutes players
